  <p><b>The Institute of Hand and Wrist Microsurgery at Hospital Management System consists of a multidisciplinary group of experts who are committed to compassionate patient care throughout the process of this surgery which includes patient evaluation.</b>
  	<h4>What is a Hand Microsurgery?</h4>
  	Surgery of the hand is a new speciality in our country. For the first time in the private sector, The HMS Group has developed a 24 hour state-of-the-art facility for comprehensive care of hand injuries.
<br>
Micro surgery is a sub-speciality performed with the aid of a microscope on structures that are barely visible to the naked eye. This sub-speciality mainly deals with 'Replantations' (reattaching severed parts of the limb). The department consists of senior consultants who have trained and worked at leading medical institutions in India and abroad.
<br>
<h4>Notable features of this department include:</h4>
<br>
<li>A dedicated operating theatre, exclusively for hand and general trauma.</li>
<br>
<li>Fully trained staff round the clock</li>
<br>
<li>Senior consultants available on call</li>
<br>
<li>Latest series of equipment</li>
<br>
<li>Continuity in management on individual basis</li>
<br>

<h4>HMS offers surgical treatment for hand injuries and problems such as:</h4>

<br>
<ul>
<li>Autologous transplant<br>The most common hand problems in infants are syndactyly (webbed fingers) and polydactyly (extra fingers). In all hand surgeries and especially pediatric hand surgeries at Apollo Hospitals, India atraumatic techniques (causing no tissue damage) are used.</li>
<br>
<li>
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome<br>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome occurs most commonly due to the compression of the median nerve at the wrist where it passes through a narrow area called the carpal tunnel. The symptoms include numbness in the thumb, index, and middle fingers especially at night or upon waking up in the morning..</li> 
<br>
<li>
Arthritis<br>
Reconstruction of painful arthritic deformities is performed routinely and includes tendon transfers, muscle release and joint displacement fusion.</li>
<br>
<li>
Reconstructive Surgery(for tumors, nerve compression and arthritis)<br>
Reconstructive hand surgery alleviates pain and helps correct deformities caused by tumors, nerve compression and arthritis. Many benign tumors of the hand and wrist don't always cause pain and subside soon. However, when pain persists or limits necessary function, removal is recommended and is almost universally curative.</li>
<br>
<li>
Microsurgery (for finger deformities)<br>
Replantation of a single finger or multiple fingers can be done through microsurgery. Even if multiple finger amputation has been done, one or more fingers can be replanted in a position that will allow functioning of the hand. Replantation surgery will be followed by rehabilitative therapy for the hand.</li>
