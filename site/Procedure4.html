  <p><b>Robotic surgery, or robot-assisted surgery, allows doctors to perform many types of complex procedures with more precision, flexibility and control than is possible with conventional techniques. Robotic surgery is usually associated with minimally invasive surgery — procedures performed through tiny incisions. It is also sometimes used in certain traditional open surgical procedures.</b>
  	<h4>About robotic surgery</h4>
  	Robotic surgery has been rapidly adopted by hospitals in the United States and Europe for use in the treatment of a wide range of conditions.
<br>
The most widely used clinical robotic surgical system includes a camera arm and mechanical arms with surgical instruments attached to them. The surgeon controls the arms while seated at a computer console near the operating table. The console gives the surgeon a high-definition, magnified, 3-D view of the surgical site. The surgeon leads other team members who assist during the operation.
<br>
<h4>Advantages:</h4>
<br>
<li>Fewer complications, such as surgical site infection</li>
<br>
<li>Less pain and blood loss</li>
<br>
<li>SQuicker recovery</li>
<br>
<li>Smaller, less noticeable scars</li>
<br>
<li>flexibility and control during the operation </li>
<br>

<h4>HMS offers surgical treatment such as:</h4>

<br>
<ul>
<li>Pelvic Surgery<br>Perhaps the greatest enthusiasm in robotic surgery points to pelvic surgery because of its good mobility and performance in a restricted confined field when compared to conventional or laparoscopic surgery. </li>
<br>
<li>
Gynecology<br>Robotic surgery is considered purely an extension of laparoscopic surgery, with improvements in the surgeon's ergonomics and more precise movements due to trembling corrections, 3-D vision, and movement accuracy, among other reasons. It is considered by some American authors as the best minimally invasive method for the treatment of malignant gynecologic lesions, presenting reduction of operative time, ranging from 4.5 to 10 hours, and lesser bleeding, with volumes from 50 to 1500 milliliters.</li> 
<br>
<li>
General Surgery<br>
In general surgery, the use of robotics contributes to improvement of dissection in oncological surgeries and better image quality by three-dimension platform as in any other procedure. However, it has the limitation to be mostly used in single abdominal quadrant surgeries. It presents the advantage of better dissection in complex surgeries, safer micro suture as well as reconstructions. In surgery for morbid obesity it is possible to conclude that there are better outcomes when using robotic technology, mainly in revisional surgeries.</li>
<br>
<li>
Cardiothoracic Surgery<br>
Cardiothoracic procedures require concentration and precision from the surgeons. In Lung resection, studies have shown that difficulties were overcome with the use of robotic in thoracic surgery, mainly due to ergonomics because of the presence of only the robot arms and the assistant in the surgical field, avoiding the inconvenience of collisions between two people in tight space.</li>
<br>
<li>
Pediatric Surgery<br>
Minimally invasive surgery with robotic assistance is considered very safe in pediatric patients and can be applied in various areas of pediatric surgery. Cholecystectomy is excellent for the development and training of new surgeons joining this technology.</li>
